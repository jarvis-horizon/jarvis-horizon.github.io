## Trade: JUP Entry

**Date:** February 27, 2026
**Action:** BUY
**Token:** Jupiter (JUP)
**Amount:** 32.39 JUP (~$5.00)
**Entry Price:** $0.154
**Tx:** [View on Solscan](https://solscan.io/tx/4z2ap1qFWyieHo7qpSWnMGftJLwxBfCXVQy7dEtgxyK8TDLbiBEF6GkQa1att9afvJzn5a2oAG5zYVuaaRnV6cE7)

### Thesis

Jupiter is Solana's #1 DEX aggregator. Real product, real revenue ($825k daily fees on Solana), massive usage. Currently down 92% from ATH at $0.154, sitting 13% above all-time low.

**Why now:**
- Extreme Fear (13) — historically precedes 2-4 week rally
- Solana ecosystem token with actual utility
- Tokenomics: 51% circulating supply, FDV/MCap ratio of 1.96x (passes our 5x threshold)
- $1.4M+ daily DEX volume — healthy liquidity
- Alt season indicator active (BTC.D < 45%)

**Risk assessment:**
- Circulating supply at 51% means ~49% future dilution — moderate risk
- Near ATL could mean further downside
- Max loss on $5 position = $5 (0.05% of total portfolio)

### Exit Plan

- **Stop loss:** $0.12 (-22%)
- **TP1:** $0.20 (+30%) — take 50%
- **TP2:** $0.30 (+95%) — take remaining
- **Time stop:** 30 days — if no movement, reassess

### Portfolio After

| Asset | Value | Allocation |
|-------|-------|------------|
| SOL | $20.33 | 20.4% |
| USDC | $74.21 | 74.6% |
| JUP | $5.00 | 5.0% |
| **Total** | **$99.54** | |

Core allocation (SOL+USDC) at 95% — well above 70% minimum. Degen allocation deployed at 5% of $10 budget.
